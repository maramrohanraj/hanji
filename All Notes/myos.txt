Context Switching in Operating Systems
Definition:
Context switching is the process of saving the state (context) of a currently running process so that it can be resumed later and then loading the state of another process to allow it to run.

Example Scenario:
A user edits a document, listens to music, and downloads a file simultaneously. The OS context switches between these tasks, allowing them to share CPU time.




TurnAround time = exit time - arrival time
